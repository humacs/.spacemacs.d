* Description
This layer extends the spacemacs go layer with additional configuration for use in literate programming.

** Features
Features include all the ones given in [[file:~/.emacs.d/layers/+lang/go/README.org][the go layer]] plus:
  - run go src blocks in org files
  - add language specific headers to these src blocks
  - ensure the go binary is added to your path, so you can confidently run go code in emacs

The layer makes use of the ob-go package, whose details you can read here: https://github.com/pope/ob-go
* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =ii-go= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.

This layer assumes you have go installed.  If not, you can install it following the guide [[https://golang.org/doc/install?download=go1.14.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz][on golang.org]]
