* Description
This layer adds support for literate pair programming when doing dev-ops work.  It is centered around using tmate in org src blocks, so that you can easily document code and see it executed on its own screen.
** Features:
  - run tmate src blocks that will auto-trigger a tmate session to share

* Install
To use this configuration layer, add it to your =~/.spacemacs=. You will need to
add =ii-mate= to the existing =dotspacemacs-configuration-layers= list in this
file.
